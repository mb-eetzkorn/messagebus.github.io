# API Documentation
It's advisable to do a local install of Jekyll, etc. so you can see what you're doing. All instructions assume you're
running MacOS and don't mind a little extra work to avoid problems down the line. If this doesn't get you running then
go to the [Jekyll troubleshooting page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/).

sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install jekyll
