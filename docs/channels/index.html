<p class="subhead">The Problem</p>
<p>
    Channels were designed to solve what's known in email circles as the "mixed content" and "mixed sender" problems,
    which refer to the practices of sending widely different types of email or using multiple <code>From:</code> domains
    over the same IP address.
</p>

<p>
    ISPs use spam filters, blacklists, user engagement, sending volumes, and other techniques to determine the safety
    and predictability of the email coming from a given IP or domain. Collectively, this is called <em>reputation</em>
    and it determines a sender's ability to deliver email and reach the inbox.
</p>

<p>
    The mixed content/sender scenarios make it difficult for these defensive systems to assign reputation because
    there's no single identity, message type, or pattern of user engagement to hang a reputation verdict on. Thus, it
    is crucial to separate high-performing mail streams from those with variable or poor performance.
</p>

<p class="subhead">The Solution</p>
<p>
    Channels achieve this isolation by sending messages from a <strong>single domain</strong>, using <strong>dedicated
    IP addresses</strong>, and independently <strong>tracking all stats and feedback</strong> like sent messages,
    bounces, opens, and more. Recipients that opt-out (e.g. by unsubscribing or filing a spam complaint) are
    automatically suppressed, as are known-bad addresses such as hard bounces.
</p>

<p class="subhead">Message Types</p>
<p>
    To keep things simple, {{ site.data.company.name }} categorizes message content as either <strong>transactional</strong>
    or <strong>non-transactional</strong>. In our experience this is the most meaningful distinction in terms of
    delivery, placement, metrics, and manageability. The key difference is the response expected of the recipient.
</p>

<ul class="body-list">
    <li>
        <strong>Transactional Messages</strong> are typically direct responses to user input. Password resets,
        purchase confirmations, alerts, and activity notifications, are common examples.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-Transactional Messages</strong> can be triggered (e.g. drip campaigns) or scheduled (e.g. promotional
        or limited-time offers) and typically contain an inducement or other call to action. Another name is
        <em>marketing mail</em>.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> the current release (as of May 2014) supports the Transactional channel type. We're
    will add support for Non-Transactional Channels in Summer 2014. Please contact us if you're interested in
    getting into the pre-release program.
</div>

<p>
    Transactional and non-transactional channels have different configurations and, in the dashboard, display different
    types of metrics and graphs. Channels also have a trick up their sleeve - Sessions.
</p>

<h3 class="text-info"><a id="{{ page.tocSubheads[2][0] }}">{{ page.tocSubheads[2][1] }}</a></h3>
<p>
    Sessions organize the traffic on a channel and individually track their own stats & feedback, so when you're
    looking at your messaging data you can see aggregates at the channel level and drill-in to each session, no work
    required on your end.
</p>
<p>
    Sessions can represent whatever you want: various types of notifications, specific customers, or periods of time.
    You create them as needed and, like channels, can name them so they're easy to spot in the dashboard.
</p>

<h3 class="text-info">Examples</h3>
<p>
    If your system sends 5 different kinds of transactional notifications, what's the best way to keep track of them? Do
    you need to create 5 channels? Not necessarily, consider the following options.
</p>
<p>
    One approach is to use a single channel and assign each type of notification to a <em>Session</em> within the
    channel. If you keep adding notifications, you just create more sessions. An advantage to this approach is
    the ability to see overall transactional performance with channel-level stats.
</p>

<p>
    Another approach is to create a channel for each type of notification. There are no limits to the number of
    channels you can create, but there is a little inconvenience. Because channels use dedicated IPs, we do not allow
    customers to create them, you must contact us to do it for you.
</p>
<p>
    Since the content is all transactional (and so the user engagement patterns will be similar), we can configure each
    of your notification channels to use the same or dedicated IPs. One advantage to using separate channels is that
    you can send on separate domains, such as alerts.domain.com, billing.domain.com, and so on.
