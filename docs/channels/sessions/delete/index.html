<!--
    Summary/Synopsis of the API. This will be inserted below the title block and the request/response blocks.
    Must be valid HTML.
-->
<p>
    Soft-deletes the session. The <code>sessionKey</code> can no longer be used for any purpose, and this action
    cannot be reversed through the API. You must contact <a href="mailto:support@messagebus.com">support</a> to recover
    a deleted session. When listing the sessions for a channel, <code>status: archived</code> can be used to identify
    deleted sessions.
</p>
<p>
    When considering whether to <code>close</code> or <code>archive</code>, the difference is that <code>closed</code>
    sessions can no longer be used to send mail. It is convenient to close them once you are done sending so that the
    number of messages remains fixed, making ratio-based metrics stable (e.g. open rate) and so they can be filtered in
    dashboard and in API calls.
