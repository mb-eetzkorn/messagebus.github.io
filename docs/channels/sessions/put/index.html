    Summary/Synopsis of the API. This will be inserted below the title block and the request/response blocks.
    Must be valid HTML.
-->
<p>
    Modifies the session parameters contained in the request body. Currently limited to renaming the session.
</p>
<p>
    Soft-deletes the session. The <code>sessionKey</code> can no longer be used for any purpose, and this action
    cannot be reversed through the API. You must contact <a href="mailto:support@messagebus.com">support</a> to recover
    a deleted session. When listing the sessions for a channel, <code>sessionStatus: archived</code> can be used to identify
    deleted sessions.
</p>
<p>
    When considering whether to close or archive a session, the difference is that <code>closed</code>
    sessions can be used just like <code>active</code> ones except they cannot send messages. It is convenient to close
    a session once you are done sending so that the number of messages remains fixed, making ratio-based metrics stable
    (e.g. open rate) and so they can be filtered in the dashboard and in API calls.
</p>
<p>
    <code>Archived</code> sessions are unavailable everywhere, move sessions into this state when you don't need them
    or their data anymore. Think of this as housekeeping.
