<h3 class="text-info">Webhooks</h3>
<p>
    A webhook is an HTTP endpoint you publish that Message Bus POSTs events to when they occur. Your data comes to you,
    instead of you needing to fetch it. The performance requirements for your webhook server depends entirely on how
    many messages you send and which events you register for. As a rule of thumb, expect to receive about <code>1.6x</code>
    as many events as you send messages.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following when setting up your webhook endpoint(s):

<ol>
    <li>A single webhook can be registered for multiple types of events.</li>
    <li>If your webhook goes down, we'll retry for 24 hours before dropping an event.</li>
    <li>Webhooks are called every 30 seconds or when 200 events of a single type have accumulated.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3 class="text-info"><a id="{{ page.tocSubheads[0][0] }}"></a>{{ page.tocSubheads[0][1] }}</h3>
<p>
    The webhook data indicates the type and number of events contained in this call. Objects in the
    <code>events</code> collection contain a set of standard fields plus the event-specific fields defined in the next
    section.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.envelope %}

<h3 class="text-info"><a id="{{ page.tocSubheads[1][0] }}"></a>{{ page.tocSubheads[1][1] }}</h3>
<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[0][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[0][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a new message is created via API or the SMTP Relay. The <code>messageId</code> field can
    be used to aggregate all subsequent events generated for this particular message, and the <code>recipient</code>
    field can be used to to accumulate statistics on a per-recipient basis. <strong>Always the first event generated
    for a given message.</strong>
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>{{ page.webhookEvents[0][1] }}</code> event has no payload other than the envelope.
</div>

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[1][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[1][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a message is successfully delivered to the recipient domain. This does not mean that the recipient
    has gotten the message - after delivery, you receive a <code>{{ page.webhookEvents[2][1] }}</code> event indicating a
    <a href="/docs/getting started/statuscodes#bounces">soft bounce</a> has occurred.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.accept %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[2][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[2][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a message has bounced. A message is said to <em>bounce</em> if it's not possible to deliver it to the
    intended recipient. Bounces are commonly classified into one of two types:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Soft</strong> - Occurring after the message has been accepted by the recipient domain, usually
        indicating a temporary non-delivery condition, like a full mailbox or the recipient is on vacation. Most
        soft-bounce conditions resolve after a short period of time, after which the recipient can receive email
        again. Accordingly, soft bounces do not result in a recipient address being added to the global or channel
        blocklists.
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
        <strong>Hard</strong> - Occurs when the recipient address is permanently non-deliverable. The most frequent
        causes are typographical errors in the email address, a previously valid address that has been abandoned, or
        the recipient domain has rejected the message for policy reasons (e.g. spam filtering).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Use the <a href="/docs/getting started/statuscodes#bounces">bounce subcode list</a> to determine the bounce's exact cause.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.bounce %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[3][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[3][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when the recipient domain has temporarily refused delivery of a message. The most common reason is
    sending too many messages over a given timeframe (e.g. hour). Message Bus will attempt to deliver deferred
    messages for 24 hours before expiring them. Expired messages can be detected by capturing the
    <code>{{ page.webhookEvents[2][1] }}</code> event and looking for <code>subCode: 1000</code>. Most deferrals wind up
    successfully delivered.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.deferral %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[4][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[4][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a message is opened.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.open %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[5][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[5][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a tracked link is clicked.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.click %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[6][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[6][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a message's unsubscribe link is clicked. This will result in the recipient address being added
    to the corresponding channel's blocklist. Beyond recording this event in your customer database, no further
    action is required to comply with the unsubscribe request.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.unsub %}

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[7][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[7][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when a message is reported as spam.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>{{ page.webhookEvents[7][1] }}</code> event has no payload other than the envelope.
</div>

<p class="subhead"><a id="{{ page.webhookEvents[8][0] }}"></a>{{ page.webhookEvents[8][1] }}</p>
<p>
    Generated when Message Bus stops delivery of a message because the recipient is on the Global or Channel blocklist.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>{{ page.webhookEvents[8][1] }}</code> event has no payload other than the envelope.
</div>



<h2>Reports</h2>
<p class="subhead">Data Formats</p>
<p>
    Because we don't know how large any given report is going to be, we stream them back formatted either as
    individual lines of JSON-formatted data or Comma Separated Values (CSV).
</p>
<p>
    Newline-delimited JSON saves you the overhead of loading a single giant object into memory for parsing, and instead
    allows you to parse and process individual lines. If you don't want to handle this yourself, the SDKs take care of
    it for you.
</p>
<pre>
{ ... }\n
{ ... }\n
{ ... }\n
</pre>

<p>
    Modern CSV parsers can accept a stream handle as input, and downloaded CSV files are easy to manipulate in Excel,
    Numbers, etc. The first line contains the column labels and subsequent lines contain data, which can be sparsely
    populated.
