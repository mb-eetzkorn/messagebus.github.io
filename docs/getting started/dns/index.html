                security protocol that determines if the domain the message appears to be from has authorized the IP

                continuing on to the original destination. This doesn't affect the user's experience, but it allows
                us to track your most popular links, how many messages were opened, and so on, as well as identify

        Message Bus makes extensive use of the DNS to implement email feedback systems and ensure best practices are
        followed.

<h3 class="text-info">Overview</h3>
<p>
    This section will walk you through the DNS changes required to connect your sending domain and other resources
    to your Message Bus account, and should be completed before you try to send. Some steps are required for account
    activation, so you'll be unable to send without first having completed them.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Conflict with existing DNS names</strong>
    <p>
        If, as you configure your Message Bus DNS records, you discover a conflict with existing DNS records just
        contact <a href="mailto:support@messagebus.com">support</a> and we'll make the changes necessary to accomodate
        your DNS configuration.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Record Format</p>
<p>
    The convention used to describe DNS records is described below, and should match the terms and options available
    to you in your DNS provider's admin tools.
</p>
<pre class="dns-record">domain  ttl  record_type  record_value</pre>

<p class="subhead">Terms</p>
<p>
    There are a few terms that you should be familiar with when implementing your DNS records.
</p>
{% include statusBlockParam.html source=page.terms %}

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    In many cases the <code>record_value</code> is a hostname that has automatically been created for you based on
    information collected when you signed up or configured a channel. If you cannot find those records in the DNS,
    immediately contact your account manager, or email support@messagebus.com.

    If your sending domain is <code>giantrobot.com</code>, then the complete set of records you would publish to get
    your Message Bus account up and running would be as follows.
