            Use Channels &amp; Sessions to separate and track different types of mail.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key reason senders get into email trouble is because they send different types of content over the same
            domains and IP addresses. Using that approach, the best performance you'll get is that of your worst-performing
            content.

            <strong>Best practices @ {{ site.data.company.name }}</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use one Channel per message type, such as alerts, notifications, newsletters, etc.</li>
            <li>Create Sessions to track unique categories, such as Password Alert, Low Balance Alert, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>{{ site.data.company.name }}</strong> employs proactive <em>reputation monitoring</em> for all
            dedicated IPs. Our clients use discrete sending <em>Channels</em> (Marketing, Transactional, Social) to
            eliminate the impact of sending <a href="/docs/channels/">mixed content</a> over any given IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Control</strong> your email destiny by segmenting your email types with {{ site.data.company.name }}
            Channels &amp; Sessions. Segment your mail, protect your reputation, and track results exactly how you need
            to.

            {{ site.data.company.name }} fully authenticates your email streams to ensure maximum delivery.

            {{ site.data.company.name }} helped write the book on DMARC - literally! Who better to send your email than
            the thought leaders in messaging authentication - that's us.

            <strong>Best practices @ {{ site.data.company.name }}</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a valid DMARC record to secure your sending domain.</li>
            <li>Implement appropriate SPF and DKIM records to ensure verified delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Email is complicated.</strong> The world is filled with nefarious actors impersonating
            well-known domains, possibly including <strong>yours</strong>, to land spam or malicious scripts
            in your customer's inbox. Implementing proper <em>Email Authentication</em> helps prevent fraud and
            ensure maximum delivery rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>{{ site.data.company.name }}</strong> provides full authentication for outgoing email,
            including the new protocol for protecting your sending domain, DMARC. Recently adopted by Yahoo! and
            AOL, DMARC stops fraudulent email at the gateway. Protecting your customers is as easy as switching to
            {{ site.data.company.name }}.
