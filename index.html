        </p>
        <p>
            The key reason senders get into email trouble is because they send different types of content over the same
            domains and IP addresses. Using that approach, the best performance you'll get is that of your worst-performing
            content. <strong>Best practices:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use one Channel per message type, such as alerts, notifications, newsletters, etc.</li>
            <li>Create Sessions to track unique categories, such as Password Alert, Low Balance Alert, etc.</li>

            <p>
                Users react differently to all types of content. These reactions are measured by how the recipient
                engages with your content. By deploying all email types off of a shared IP address, the shared IP
                address is at the mercy of every piece of content that it deploys. In turn, the reputation of that IP
                address suffers greatly and all content becomes at risk for delivery issues.
            </p>
            <p class="subhead">{{ site.data.company.name }} Solution</p>
            <p>
                Message Bus clients deploy each email type through its own dedicated IP address. By creating discrete
                Channels for sending distinct types of traffic, there is no cross-pollination of content across a shared
                IP. Therefore, should an issue occur with one Channel, it has no affect on the rest of your email
                program. Control your own email destiny by segmenting your message types with Message Bus email Channels
                and Sessions. Segment, protect, then track results of each email channel individually or in aggregate.

            {{ site.data.company.name }} helped write the book on DMARC - literally! Who better to send your email than

        <ol>

            <p>
                Email is complicated. It is further complicated by nefarious actors impersonating well-known domains,
                possibly including <strong>yours</strong>, to land spam or malicious scripts in the user's inbox. So
                how does one ensure that email being sent and received is actually form the desired source?
            </p>
            <p class="subhead">{{ site.data.company.name }} Solution</p>
            <p>
                {{ site.data.company.name }} provides full authentication of every message we send on behalf of our
                clients. This ensures receiving ISPs like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Comcast and more can quickly and
                easily separate authentic, original email from impostors.
            </p>
            <p>
                {{ site.data.company.name }} goes even further than most ESPs by providing a valid DMARC record to
                ensure that ISPs implementing this protocol can actively discard phony messages attempting to
                impersonate {{ site.data.company.name }} client brands. With all major domestic ISPs and many
                international email providers participating, your end-user recipients are protected!

                <strong>Clients with full authentication can expect to see maximum delivery rates with {{ site.data.company.name }}</strong>

                Email generates amazing and actionable engagement data, yet most ESPs don't provide access to this data
                in a manner enabling senders to use it properly. What's the best way for clients to access and leverage
                this extremely useful email-driven data?

            <p class="subhead">{{ site.data.company.name }} Solution</p>
            <p>
                By using {{ site.data.company.name }} Webhooks, clients have access to all of their email engagement data
                including but not limited to opens, clicks, unsubscribes, time-of-open, time-of-click, geolocation, hard
                bounces, and much more.
