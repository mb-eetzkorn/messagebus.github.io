<!--
    Summary/Synopsis of the API. This will be inserted below the title block and the request/response blocks.
    Must be valid HTML.
-->
<p>
    Sends messages singly or in batches of up to 100 messages. The Send API is best for messages that are completely unrelated or have highly personalized or widely variable
    content, where templates would have limited advantage or increased overhead relative to simpler API calls.
